# My first Godot project

## Goals
Using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAh_Kx5Zh5Q), I am trying to learn how to use Godot game engine to make a 2D platformer.
Meanwhile I am also using this project to familiarize myself with Github for organizing.

## Method
I will use Godot with GDScript to create the game logic and Pixelorama for designing characters, level, environments etc.

## Details
While I'm in the initial learning stage of the game, the **Main** branch will primarily be my attempts to follow the tutorial mentioned at the top.
Whereas the **Testing** will be used to explore random ideas I have while working on the game.

## Results
The (hopefully one day) finished game will be free and open source.
